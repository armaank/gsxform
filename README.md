## TODO
* add release management (long term)
* add badge for code cov, tests, docs(passing)
* add code coverage
* add unit tests for `graph.py`
### TODO Sat. July 16th
* work with spectral scattering and diffusion scattering transforms
* test the above, replicate previous results


## Developer Instructions
* follow [NumPy dev
  workflow](https://numpy.org/doc/1.14/dev/gitwash/development_workflow.html) naming convention
*
